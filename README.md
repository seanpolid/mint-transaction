<h1>Overview</h1>
Transaction Tracker is an app that I've been wanting to make for a while. Here are the high level goals:
<ol>
  <li>Provide users an intuitive interface so they can easily log their transactions.</li>
  <li>Provide a basic dashboard that summarizes the user's transaction history over various time periods.</li>
  <li>Give users the opportunity to create goals. Use this information to create a daily notification service that tells the user the total amount of money they can spend each day to reach their goal.</li>
</ol>
